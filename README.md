Write a program that works as follow:
• The user is allowed to choose from a printed menu the list to be
sorted as follow:
1. Sorted List
2. Inversely Sorted List
• Then the user is allowed to choose the specific sorting
technique to be applied to sort the previously selected list,
among the 6 listed ones:
1. Merge Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. All of them
• The program should determine the number of comparisons,
assignment statements and swaps done for each sorting
technique.
• The program should display a comparison among the sorting
techniques' regarding the number of comparisons, the
assignment statements. That’s when the user choose all of
them.
